# Cloudformation

Use the Cloudformation user guide to create a working template that will launch in your environment. You can find the Cloudformation Resource Type Reference here:

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html

You'll need to gather from your environment your security group, instance type, and the image Id to add to your template. Watch out for the security group! Make sure it's in brackets, with parenthesis, [" "] and pay attention to whether you use the ID or the name of the security group in your template.

You'll need to gather from the AWS guidance the correct "type" and syntax for all.
